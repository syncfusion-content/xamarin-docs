# Localization in Xamarin DateTime Range Navigator

You can localize [`SfDateTimeRangeNavigator`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/xamarin/Syncfusion.RangeNavigator.XForms.SfDateTimeRangeNavigator.html) in all the platforms by adding a .resx file in a .NET Standard project alone. The following steps describe how to localize SfDateTimeRangeNavigator in a project.

N> Here, the resources have been already created for some cultures and shared them on [`Syncfusion® GitHub`](https://github.com/syncfusion/xamarin-localized-texts) for your convenience.

1. Add a new folder in the .NET Standard project named Resources.

2. Add resource files for the languages you wish to support and set their Build Action to EmbeddedResource. The name of the resource file should be $name of the Syncfusion® component$+$language code$+.resx. For example, if you add a resource file for the French culture, add the Syncfusion.SfChart.XForms.fr-FR.resx file to Resources folder as illustrated in the following screenshot.

3. Provide the French values for each key in the respective .resx files. Here, “Quarter” and “Week” are the keys, and “Trimestre” and “La semaine” are their respective French values.

{% highlight xml %}

<data name="Quarter" xml:space="preserve">
  <value>Trimestre</value>
</data>
<data name="Week" xml:space="preserve">
  <value>La semaine</value>
</data>  

{% endhighlight %} 

4. Set resource manager to [‘RangeNavigatorResourceManager.Manager’](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/xamarin/Syncfusion.SfChart.XForms.RangeNavigatorResourceManager.html#Syncfusion_SfChart_XForms_RangeNavigatorResourceManager_Manager) to get the resource manager from users as demonstrated in the following code sample. For more details, please refer [`Localization`](https://blog.syncfusion.com/post/localization-made-easy-for-syncfusion-xamarin-forms-components.aspx).

{% highlight C# %}

RangeNavigatorResourceManager.Manager = new ResourceManager("GettingStarted.Resources.Syncfusion.SfChart.XForms", Application.Current.GetType().Assembly);

{% endhighlight %} 

## Localize at application level

You can also localize the text at application-level regardless of the language selected on the device. The following platform-specific codes are needed to localize the text at application-level. Use the [`DependencyServices`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/app-fundamentals/dependency-service/introduction) to set this from .NET Standard project.

{% highlight C# %}

//For Android and iOS,
Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = new CultureInfo("fr-FR");

//For UWP,
CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture = new CultureInfo("fr-FR");

{% endhighlight %}
