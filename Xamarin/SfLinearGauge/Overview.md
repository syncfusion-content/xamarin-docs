# Overview

Linear Gauge displays a range of values graphically along the linear scale. It is considered as the linear form of the Circular Gauge. It measures the values of the scale and it is present in the horizontal or vertical sliding or meter. Linear Gauge is used to identify the quantitative values in analog format. It is rendered as a canvas image. By using the Linear Gauge control, it is possible to render the thermometer.
