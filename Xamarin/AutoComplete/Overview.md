# Overview of Xamarin.Forms AutoComplete (SfAutoComplete)

Essential [AutoComplete for Xamarin.Forms](https://www.syncfusion.com/xamarin-ui-controls/xamarin-autocomplete) provides a simple way to complete text based on the characters that the user has entered. It also provides options to choose a suggestion from a drop-down list or append a suggestion to the text directly.

## Key Features

* **AutoComplete Modes** - AutoComplete provides three different ways to display filtered suggestions: displaying suggestions through a drop-down list, appending the first suggestion to text, or both.

* **Suggestion Modes** - Suggestions can be filtered in nine different modes, such as StartsWith, EndsWith, Contains, Equals, Custom, etc. AutoComplete provides both case-sensitive and case-insensitive modes.

* **Watermark** - Supports explanatory text inside the AutoComplete control until the user inputs text. The watermark is restored if the user clears the text in the control.

* **Popup Delay & Minimum Prefix Characters** - Filtering process can be delayed by providing the minimum character count, after which AutoComplete starts giving suggestions. Displaying the filtered suggestions through a drop-down list can also be delayed for a specified time duration.

* **Customization Support** - AutoComplete provides options to customize both the Entry and Suggestion drop-down.

* **Multiple Selection** - AutoComplete provides two different ways to select multiple items from the suggestion list: using Token representation and Delimiter. In Token mode, the text can be wrapped in two ways: Wrap and None. In Wrap mode, text will wrap to the next line. When using None, the text will be wrapped horizontally.

* **Load More** - Restrict the number of suggestions displayed and load the remaining items by selecting LoadMore.

* **Header and Footer** - Header and Footer content can be added to the top and bottom of the Suggestion list in SfAutoComplete.

* **Diacritic Sense** - AutoComplete supports populating items from languages with letters containing diacritics, and allows searching for them with English characters from an en-US keyboard.

* **Highlighting Text** - AutoComplete provides highlighting of matching text in the Suggestion list based on the input given.

* **Custom Filter** - AutoComplete allows users to filter items in the Suggestion list based on custom filtering conditions.
