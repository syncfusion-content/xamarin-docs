# Xamarin Masked Entry (SfMaskedEdit) Overview

The Masked text box is an advanced version of the Entry control that restricts your input to certain types of characters, text, and numbers using a mask pattern. This control is used to create a template for providing information such as telephone numbers, IP addresses, product IDs, and so on.
