# OVERVIEW

**Essential Barcode** for Xamarin.Forms provides a perfect approach to encode texts using supported symbol types that comprises one dimensional barcodes and two dimensional barcodes. The basic structure of a barcode consists of one or more data characters, optionally one or two check characters, a start pattern as well as a stop pattern.
