# Xamarin Segmented Control (SfSegmentedControl) Overview

The Segmented Control for Xamarin.Forms provides a simple way to choose from a linear set of two or more segments, each of which functions as a mutually exclusive button.

* Populates the segments from a collection of strings and views along with the objects of built-in classes.

* Supports customizing text and other UI elements.
