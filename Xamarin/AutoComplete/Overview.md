# Xamarin AutoComplete (SfAutoComplete) Overview

Essential [AutoComplete for Xamarin.Forms](https://www.syncfusion.com/xamarin-ui-controls/xamarin-autocomplete) provides a simpler way to complete the text based on the characters that the user has entered before. It also provides option to choose a suggestion from drop down or append a suggestion to the text directly.
