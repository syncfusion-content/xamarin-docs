# Xamarin Navigation Drawer (SfNavigationDrawer) Overview

The Essential NavigationDrawer for Xamarin.Forms is a straightforward component used to create a navigation pane in applications. It consists of a content area and a sliding pane that can slide out from the edge of the page. The pane can be opened by swiping the screen edges or programmatically.
