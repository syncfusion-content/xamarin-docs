# Working with ScrollHead in Xamarin Pdf Viewer (SfPdfViewer)

The scroll head in the [Xamarin PDF Viewer](https://www.syncfusion.com/xamarin-ui-controls/xamarin-pdf-viewer) allows users to easily scroll through and navigate to destination page in the PDF document. ScrollHead always appears on the right side of PDF Viewer.

## Enabling and disabling ScrollHead

By setting the `EnableScrollHead` property of the PdfViewerControl instance to false, you can disable the scroll head.

<table>

<tr>
<th>Property</th>
<th>Action</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>EnableScrollHead</td>
<td>Gets or sets the value that enable and disable the ScrollHead feature in PDF Viewer. By default, this property is set to true.</td>
</tr>

</table>

{% tabs %}
{% highlight xaml %}

<pdfviewer:SfPdfViewer x:Name="pdfViewerControl" EnableScrollHead="False"/>

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}

//Disables the scroll head
pdfViewerControl.EnableScrollHead = false;

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

## Navigate to a desired page using ScrollHead

PDF Viewer allows users to navigate to a desired destination page using ScrollHead. On tapping the ScrollHead of PDF Viewer, a page navigation pop-up will appear and users can navigate to the destination page by entering a valid page number.
