# Localization in Xamarin Charts (SfChart)

You can localize [`SfChart`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/xamarin/Syncfusion.SfChart.XForms.SfChart.html) in all the platforms by adding a .resx file in a .NET Standard project alone. The following steps describe how to localize SfChart in a project and you can download the complete sample from this [`link`](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/how-to-localize-the-labels-in-xamarin-forms-sfchart).

N> Here, the resources have been already created for some cultures and shared them on [`Syncfusion GitHub`](https://github.com/syncfusion/xamarin-localized-texts) for your convenience.

* Add a new folder in the .NET Standard project named Resources.

* Add resource files for the languages you wish to support, and set their Build Action to EmbeddedResource. The name of the resource file should be $name of the Syncfusion component$+$language code$+.resx. For example, if you add a resource file for the French culture, add the Syncfusion.SfChart.XForms.fr-FR.resx file to Resources folder as illustrated in the following screenshot.

* Provide the French values for each key in the respective .resx files. Here, “Close” and “High” are the keys, and “Fermer” and “Haute” are their respective French values.

{% capture codesnippet1 %}
{% tabs %}
{% highlight xml %}

<data name="Close" xml:space="preserve">
  <value>Fermer</value>
</data>
<data name="High" xml:space="preserve">
  <value>Haute</value>
</data>  

{% endhighlight %} 
{% endtabs %}
{% endcapture %}
{{ codesnippet1 | UnOrderList_Indent_Level_1 }}

* Set the resource manager to [‘ChartResourceManager.Manager’](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/xamarin/Syncfusion.SfChart.XForms.ChartResourceManager.html#Syncfusion_SfChart_XForms_ChartResourceManager_Manager) as demonstrated in the following code to get the resource manager from the users. For more details, refer [`Localization`](https://blog.syncfusion.com/post/localization-made-easy-for-syncfusion-xamarin-forms-components.aspx).

{% capture codesnippet2 %}
{% tabs %}
{% highlight C# %}

ChartResourceManager.Manager = new ResourceManager("GettingStarted.Resources.Syncfusion.SfChart.XForms", Application.Current.GetType().Assembly);

{% endhighlight %} 
{% endtabs %}
{% endcapture %}
{{ codesnippet2 | UnOrderList_Indent_Level_1 }}

## Localize at application level

You can also localize the text at application-level regardless of the language selected on the device. The following platform-specific codes are needed to localize the text at application-level. Use the [`DependencyServices`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/app-fundamentals/dependency-service/introduction) to set this from .NET Standard project.

{% highlight C# %}

//For Android and iOS,
Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = new CultureInfo("fr-FR");

//For UWP,
CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture = new CultureInfo("fr-FR");

{% endhighlight %}
