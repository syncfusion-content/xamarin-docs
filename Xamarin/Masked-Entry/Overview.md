# Xamarin Masked Entry (SfMaskedEdit) Overview

The Masked Text Box is an advanced version of the Entry control, designed to restrict input to specific types of characters, text, and numbers using a mask pattern. This control is ideal for creating templates to capture information such as telephone numbers, IP addresses, product IDs, and more.
