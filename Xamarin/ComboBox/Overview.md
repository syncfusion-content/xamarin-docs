# Xamarin ComboBox (SfComboBox) Overview

The ComboBox is a textbox component that allows users to enter a value or select an option from a list of predefined options. This control comes with built-in features such as data binding, filtering, UI customization, and more.

## Key Features

- **Editable Mode**: Supports both editable and non-editable text boxes for selecting an item from a given data source.

- **Filtering Mode**: Offers options to support filtering and non-filtering suggestion lists, and provides three ways to display filtered suggestions, including using a drop-down list, appending the first suggestion to text, or a combination of both.

- **Suggestion Modes**: Filter suggestions using various modes such as StartsWith, EndsWith, Contains, Equals, Custom, and more. ComboBox supports both case-sensitive and case-insensitive modes. Items filter only when the Allow Filtering property is enabled.

- **Multi-Selection**: Offers two different methods for selecting multiple items from the suggestion list: using Token representation and Delimiter. In Token mode, text can wrap in two ways: Wrap, which wraps text to the next line, and None, which wraps text horizontally.

- **Customization Support**: Provides options to customize both the Entry and the Suggestion drop-down.

- **Header and Footer**: Add header and footer content to the top and bottom of the suggestion list in SfComboBox.

- **Highlighting Text**: Highlights matching text in the suggestion list based on user input.

- **Watermark**: Displays explanatory text inside the ComboBox control until the user inputs text. It is restored if the user clears the text in the control.
