# Xamarin Parallax View (SfParallaxView) Overview

SfParallaxView for Xamarin.Forms provides a perfect way for scrolling any control that implements the IParallaxView interface with a background element that translates slower than the foreground element. The SfParallaxView control binds the scroll position of a foreground element (e.g., list) to a background element and moves the background element at different speeds.

## Key features

* Customizes the speed of the parallax scroll.
* Supports horizontal and vertical orientation.
* Provides built-in integration with SfListView and SfRotator.
* Bind any control which implements IParallaxView interface.
